✅ Goals

Secure User API
Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
Password Hashing (bcrypt)
Rate Limiting (Flask-Limiter)
Input Validation (Flask-Schema or Marshmallow)
Test Cases (using pytest and Flask-Testing)
Security-Focused Tests (e.g. SQL injection, brute-force detection)
Test Coverage Report (pytest-cov)

# Perfect! Let's proceed with a secure Flask API using PostgreSQL, along with:

JWT-based authentication
Bcrypt password hashing
SQLAlchemy ORM
Flask-Limiter (rate limiting)
Full test suite with pytest, pytest-cov, and Flask-Testing
Security test cases (e.g., brute-force, SQL injection)

# implement a secure Flask API with the following features and best practices:

✅ Features:
User Registration and Login
JWT Authentication
Password Hashing using bcrypt
Rate Limiting using Flask-Limiter
PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
Security Best Practices (no sensitive data in responses, proper error handling)
Test Coverage using Pytest & Flask-Testing
